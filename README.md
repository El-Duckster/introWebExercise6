# Introduction to Web Development - Exercise 6

## Project Overview

This project is a requirement for passing an assignment at Lernia Yrkesh√∂gskola, its web application that takes user input and converts the text to uppercase letters. The conversion is handled by a JavaScript function, and unit tests are used to verify the functionality. The project uses **Jest** as the testing framework to ensure code correctness and maintainability.

## Features

- Input text is converted to uppercase letters.
- The result is displayed in the console and on the webpage.
- Unit tests are implemented to ensure the correctness of the `convertToUpperCase` function.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **JavaScript**: The core functionality to manipulate the text input.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for running unit tests.
- **Babel**: For transpiling ES modules to work with Jest.

# to start the testing:

- use npm run test
